# React + Flask starter kit

A quick starter repo that includes Flask and React, with Babel and Webpack.

## Setup

For the backend:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the frontend:

```
npm install
```

If you don't have webpack, install it:

```
npm install -g webpack
```

## Running the app

If you're using a virtualenv, activate it.

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then run the Flask app:

```
python app.py
```
